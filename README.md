## Introduction
Project for the Introduction to Data Science Module of the Become a Data Scientist Udacity's Nanodegree
In this project we use Airbnb data from Seattle and Boston to answer 3 questions:

1. What areas generate more revenue?
2. What kind of properties is best suited for these areas?
3. Can we predict future revenue?

The project followed the CRISP-DM methodology and is commented so it's easier to understand.

There is also a Medium article about this project [here](https://medium.com/@gfmarafon/airbnb-revenue-showdown-5d3b4cd71049).
